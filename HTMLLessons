LESSON 3

What is HTML?
HTML is a language used to describe the structure of a webpage. It is used 
tell the browser how to arrange the contents of a web page.

Pages are made up of elements. HTML is used to describe what elements a page
contains and how to arrange those elements. Elements of a web page
- title, paragraph, header, list, table...

HTML also describes formats - 


HTML does not describe how elements are formatted or how they appear on the page

A Web browser is also an HTML formatter...it parses HTML document and formats
them on the screen...Browser maps from html element to styles on screen

tags indicate different parts of a web page and have different effects on the browser - i.e. a browser reacts differently to different tags.

An HTML doc has two parts - the text, the tags

Attribute are used to describe additional information about a tag
Attributes are used to modify elements
The ID attribute is used to uniquely identify an element within a page
Identifiers are used with JS and CSS
The class attribute is used to identify a particular group of elements

CSS is used to control the look and feel of a web doc...CSS can be used to tell
the browser to render an element differently from how it normally would

Styles can be placed in sheets and web pages can link to those sheets.
Styles can be applied site-wide, page-wide, class wide or even to a specific element. Style sheets are page wide, the style attribute is used to apply
style to a specific element

Rules can be applied to individual elements, to groups of elements
