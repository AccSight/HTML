      The absence of romance in my history will, I fear, detract somewhat
      <span id="outer">from its <span id="inner"> interest</span></span
      >; but if it be judged useful by those inquirers who desire an exact
      knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future, which
      in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect it, I
      shall be content. In fine, I have written my work, not as an essay which
      is to win the applause of the moment, but as a possession for all time.
