      Files are organized in a structure - a hierachy. The browser has an image
      tag. This too is an element. The image tag has a pointer - src. The
      broswer will display an image located where its image pointer is pointing
      to. The image to be displayed is placed somewhere on the computer.
      floating means you place it against the edge of its containing container.
      It also means that you keep the box as small as possible, big enough to
      fit text. So float right means place it against the right edge of its
      parent container and make its box as small as possible You see, by
      floating left you make line it up against the edge and make it as small as
      possible. This leaves room for other elements to occupy the same row as
      the floated element. Without floating, the element takes up the entire
      row, with floating it's only as wide as it needs to be. All elements have
      to be floated independently. If the second element is not floated, it will
      fill up the entire row and make a mess. That's what floating means. Images
      can be floated.
