      The absence of romance in my history will, I fear, detract somewhat from
      its interest; but if it be judged useful by those inquirers who desire an
      exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future,
      which in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect
      it, I shall be content.

      which is to win the applause of the moment, but as a possession for all
      time.
